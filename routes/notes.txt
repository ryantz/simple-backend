1) Organize routes: project structure, separate files n modules

2) Create Route Files: in route folder, route files for different parts of application
   eg user.js for user related routes and products.js for product related routes

3) Import dependencies: eg Express or other required modules

4) Define Routes: using Express etc.... eg responding to GET request

5) Use routes in your application: include and use route files in main file

6) Test routes: can test by sending HTTP requests to defind routes using Postman or just
   open in web browser
